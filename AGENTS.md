## **Programming style, code characteristics, philosophy to use**
* **Pipeline programming**
* **Data-oriented programming**
* **Functional-like programming**
* **Declarative-like programming**
* **Side-effect isolation** (I/O only in `main`)
* **Expression-oriented programming**
* **Structured, composable functions**
* **No mutable global state**
* **Prefer not to have even local mutable state unless absolutely needed to gain smth much more valuable**
* **Prefer not to have explicit `source code`-level loops unless absolutely needed to gain smth much more valuable**
* **Pure functions**
* **Minimal branching, maximal transformation**
* **Clean, predictable control flow**
* **Lean functional patterns**
* **Less code means better. Keep code dense. Code is a liability, not an asset**
* **The code is not opimized to gain maximum raw speed**
* **The code is kept vertical, so it stays within a regular monitor size, no need for endless zooming, scroling nonsense**
* **The code is opimized for correctness, simplicity and clarity**
* **The code is straightforward like do 1, do 2, do 3, get result**
